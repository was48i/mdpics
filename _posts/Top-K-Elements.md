Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent "K" elements among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of "K" elements is `Heap`. This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with "K" elements at a time from a set of given elements.
