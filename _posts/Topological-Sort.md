Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event "B" is dependent on event "A", "A" comes before "B" in topological ordering.

This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements and then solves a few problems using it.
