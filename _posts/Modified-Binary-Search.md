As we know, whenever we are given a sorted `Array` or `LinkedList` or `Matrix`, and we are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm we can use is the Binary Search.

This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search. We will go through a set of problems that will help us build an understanding of this pattern so that we can apply this technique to other problems we might come across in the interviews.
